Next Steps:

1. Next steps would be to add transitions for the overlays and animation for movement of the snake.

2. For now only 1 arena is available to play ( with the walls on all sides ) . The program is modular and the arena class can be extended by adding new arena types to chose from in the begining of the game.

3. The game has a constant speed and the snake length increases by only one. Different difficulty levels can be introduced by changing the config object for the game.This can be done by reducing the time interval or increasing the increment size.
